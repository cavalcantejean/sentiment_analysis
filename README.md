# Project: Sentiment Analysis

## Install

This project requires **Python 3.8** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `SageMaker Project.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `sentiment_analysis/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook 'SageMaker Project.ipynb'
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook 'SageMaker Project.ipynb'
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
